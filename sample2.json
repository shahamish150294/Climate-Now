If the shower takes 5 min, it requires 100 L with a normal showerhead, but if it has a retrofit device, the water consumption will be only 50 L. These values are always less than the water consumption of a bath (250 L). The showerhead may be replaced to a retrofit device that reduces the initial consumption of 20 to 10 L / min.For instance, for a 5 min shower, the water savings could change from 100 to 50 L."],
